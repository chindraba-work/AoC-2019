Advent Of Code 2019

This is the repository for my solutions to the challenges for the 2019 Advent of Code.

The challenges can be reviewed at [https://adventofcode.com/2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Unlike other repos I produce, this will not use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). It seems pointless to do so. Rather changes will be tracked based on the "Day" of the challenge they come from. Hopefully, by day 25, the code for day 1 will still work.

To run these scripts locally, the current directory needs to be in the `@INC` list, which was the default, but has been changed for security concerns. That change can be reversed by using the Bash command `export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1`, or by adding the line `use lib "."` to the main launching Perl file. Of course, the safe choice is to add the directories from the repo to your `site_perl` directory. That's a good option for my development, not so good for someone wanting to test my code.

Day Two involves creating a computer to run "Intcode" programs. This will be a long project for me as I'm not trying to gain points, but want to have fun. This "computer" ought to be a nice challenge if done right.
