=head1 NAME

IntCode::AsmComp::Internals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IntCode::AsmComp::Internals;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation of the low-level architecture of the IntCode computer
needed by the elves in the 2019 Advent of Code challenges.

Exported variables are:
    %address_mode
        A hash for converting text names of address modes into integers
            with multiple names possible for individual numbers. The
            actual intrepretation of the number into practical use is
            the responsibility of a higher module.
    @core_ram
        An array to emulate the memory of the CPU. Kept independent of
            the code memory. Similar in concept to the code segment and
            data segment of the x86 CPU family, except that the line is
            hard, with no overlap between the two.
    %process_registers
        A hash representing the "registers" of the emulated CPU.
    @program_code
        An array to emulate the code segment of memory. The commands to
            be executed by the CPU are here. Tracked with the "code
            pointer" (C) register.
    @stack_heap
        An array to emulate the stack of the CPU, tracked with the 
            "stack pointer" (S) register.
    %status_flags
        A hash of bit values representing the "status flags" of the CPU
            when mapped onto the Status Register (F) of the CPU.
